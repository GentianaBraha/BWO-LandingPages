        <div data-role="content">
            <p>Once your order's confirmed, you'll receive an email with payment instructions within two days from
                Klarna. You'll then have 14 days to try on your order and only pay when you’re happy. Complete the
                payment online, at your convenience, with no extra cost. You can pay via credit or debit card at <a

        <div data-role="content">
            <p>To use Pay later you must be at least 18. Whilst this option is widely promoted, Pay later is subject
                to your financial circumstances. When choosing Pay later, our assessment will not affect your credit

            <p>Klarna is unique and offers Pay later based on a number of factors such as the order value, previous
                order history and item availability. If you are 18 or over, you can improve your chances of being
                offered Pay later by ensuring you provide your full name and accurate address details and shipping
                to your registered billing address. All orders are assessed individually. Just because you have had
                Pay later before does not mean it will be offered for every order and in turn, as it is denied does
                not mean it will be denied for all future orders.</p>

                sent to your email address. It's very important that you give us the correct details, as otherwise
